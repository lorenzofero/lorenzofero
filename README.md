### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Tide Protocol, for Five Elements Labs


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Zero Knowledge Proofs, from this [MOOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGEXYpt3sj0)
- The Zig programming language
- Distributed Systems and P2P, in the context of blockchains
  
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Rust x Ethereum open source projects. My contributions have mostly been on [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm), the Rust implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine
